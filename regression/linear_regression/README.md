# Linear Regression: EV Scooter Battery Degradation

This project demonstrates how to predict electric scooter battery degradation using linear regression.

## Features Used
- **Daily distance traveled (km)**
- **Number of charge cycles**
- **Average temperature (Â°C)**

## Files
- `linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.
- `linear_regression.py`: Python script with the same logic as the notebook.
- `sample_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset generated for regression.
- `plot.png`: 2D plot of actual vs predicted battery remaining.
- `plot3D.png`: 3D plot showing actual and predicted battery remaining.

## How to Use
1. Run the notebook or script to generate synthetic data and fit a linear regression model.
2. The data and plots will be saved in the current directory.
3. You can adjust the parameters in the code to experiment with different scenarios.

## Output
- The model predicts the remaining battery percentage after 2 years based on the input features.
- Visualizations help compare actual and predicted values.
